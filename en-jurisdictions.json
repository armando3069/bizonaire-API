But it has plenty of advantages concerning company establishment and management, some of them being: low taxes compared to the rest of the countries in Europe, developed banking system, working flexibility of state institutions, online accounting reporting and the use of electronic signatures. Another benefit of setting up a company in the Republic of Moldova is that your involvement in the process can be minimal, as we at Bizonaire offer you personalized solutions that will fit your personal needs.</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 55);\">How do you register a Company in Moldova? 3 easy steps!</strong></p><p><strong>1st step</strong></p><p>First things first, you have to decide what is the type of activity that your company will undertake so that we can provide advice on the most appropriate entity for your needs. Below, we present some basic information regarding the most popular types of companies. But for a more in depth analysis you can read one of our previous articles on this subject.</p><p>A <strong>Limited Liability Company </strong>is formed by one or more individuals through a written agreement that includes provisions for management, assignability of interests, and distribution of profits and losses. It’s suitable for most trading businesses, it can operate anywhere in the world and can undertake almost any nature of activity other than banking or insurance.</p><p>A <strong>Joint Stock Company</strong> is necessary if the firm is planning to trade its shares to the public. It can operate anywhere in the world and is suitable for any nature of business, but it requires a high initial capital requirement.</p><p>A <strong>Sole Proprietorship Company</strong> is one individual or married couple in business alone. They are the most common form of business structure, it being easy to form and operate and flexible to manage, facing fewer legal controls and fewer taxes. However, the business owner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business.</p><p>Also, at this stage you have to pick the name of your company. This is both an exciting and also very important step, as the name of an enterprise is in most cases correlated to its success. The right name can make your company the talk of the town and the wrong one can doom it to failure. Ideally, your name should convey the expertise, value and uniqueness of the product or the service you offer.</p><p><strong>2nd step</strong></p><p>The next step does not require your involvement at all, just provide us with a copy of your Passport (if you are a foreign citizen) or Identity Card (if you are a citizen of Republic of Moldova). We are going to take care of all the needed documents and permits such as: Notification from the National Commission for the Financial Market for insurance agencies, social and pension funds and credit organizations, Decision on the establishment of a legal entity and its constituent documents, confirmation of payment of registration tax and others. Subsequently, we will apply on your behalf for the registration of the company at the Public Services Agency, giving you the opportunity to avoid the lines and the bureaucratic aspect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3rd step</strong></p><p>The last step consists of signing the company formation documents and receiving your newly registered firm’s document package. This is the only involvement required from you, as it is compulsory that you sign the papers yourself.&nbsp;You will be accompanied by our representatives to the Public Services Agency where you are going to sign the documents, for foreign citizens this procedure is preceded by a visit to the notary where a translator will present all the information included in the documents. We can also arrange transportation and accommodation for you, making sure your trip to Moldova is a productive and pleasant experience.</p><p>At Bizonaire, we aim to provide you a hassle-free experience regarding every aspect of your business. You name it and we have a solution to make it easier and more productive. We are all about efficiency and optimization without compromising the results.

Moldova’s large-scale out-migration, combined with decreasing fertility rates, has led to an alarming decline in the population and increased the share of elderly people. This puts pressure on the pension system and limits the country’s long-term competitiveness.</p><p>In the near term, the formation of a new government supported by a parliamentary majority established in June 2019 is an opportunity to regain trust among citizens and international partners, strengthen the political system, de-polarize society, combat corruption, and speed up the reforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","info_legal":"<p>The Republic of Moldova is a location that is yet to be discovered as a business destination and an option that suits the needs of entrepreneurs. But it has plenty of advantages concerning company establishment and management, some of them being: low taxes compared to the rest of the countries in Europe, developed banking system, working flexibility of state institutions, online accounting reporting and the use of electronic signatures. Another benefit of setting up a company in the Republic of Moldova is that your involvement in the process can be minimal, as we at Bizonaire offer you personalized solutions that will fit your personal needs.</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 55);\">How do you register a Company in Moldova? 3 easy steps!</strong></p><p><strong>1st step</strong></p><p>First things first, you have to decide what is the type of activity that your company will undertake so that we can provide advice on the most appropriate entity for your needs. Below, we present some basic information regarding the most popular types of companies. But for a more in depth analysis you can read one of our previous articles on this subject.</p><p>A <strong>Limited Liability Company </strong>is formed by one or more individuals through a written agreement that includes provisions for management, assignability of interests, and distribution of profits and losses. It’s suitable for most trading businesses, it can operate anywhere in the world and can undertake almost any nature of activity other than banking or insurance.</p><p>A <strong>Joint Stock Company</strong> is necessary if the firm is planning to trade its shares to the public. It can operate anywhere in the world and is suitable for any nature of business, but it requires a high initial capital requirement.</p><p>A <strong>Sole Proprietorship Company</strong> is one individual or married couple in business alone. They are the most common form of business structure, it being easy to form and operate and flexible to manage, facing fewer legal controls and fewer taxes. However, the business owner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business.</p><p>Also, at this stage you have to pick the name of your company. This is both an exciting and also very important step, as the name of an enterprise is in most cases correlated to its success. The right name can make your company the talk of the town and the wrong one can doom it to failure. Ideally, your name should convey the expertise, value and uniqueness of the product or the service you offer.</p><p><strong>2nd step</strong></p><p>The next step does not require your involvement at all, just provide us with a copy of your Passport (if you are a foreign citizen) or Identity Card (if you are a citizen of Republic of Moldova). We are going to take care of all the needed documents and permits such as: Notification from the National Commission for the Financial Market for insurance agencies, social and pension funds and credit organizations, Decision on the establishment of a legal entity and its constituent documents, confirmation of payment of registration tax and others. Subsequently, we will apply on your behalf for the registration of the company at the Public Services Agency, giving you the opportunity to avoid the lines and the bureaucratic aspect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3rd step</strong></p><p>The last step consists of signing the company formation documents and receiving your newly registered firm’s document package. This is the only involvement required from you, as it is compulsory that you sign the papers yourself.&nbsp;You will be accompanied by our representatives to the Public Services Agency where you are going to sign the documents, for foreign citizens this procedure is preceded by a visit to the notary where a translator will present all the information included in the documents. We can also arrange transportation and accommodation for you, making sure your trip to Moldova is a productive and pleasant experience.</p><p>At Bizonaire, we aim to provide you a hassle-free experience regarding every aspect of your business. You name it and we have a solution to make it easier and more productive. We are all about efficiency and optimization without compromising the results. Embark on a business journey with us and we assure that you can forget about many stressful aspects that running a business implies.&nbsp;</p>","info_taxes":"<p>Moldovan residents (both Moldovan citizens and foreigners) are subject to taxation for their income received during the fiscal period from any sources within the Republic of Moldova, as well as from sources outside the country for their work activity effectively performed in the Republic of Moldova (except income that is expressly tax exempt under the Moldovan law).</p><p>Moldovan citizens receiving investment and financial income from sources outside Moldova are also subject to tax on this income in Moldova.At the same time, individuals qualifying as non-residents for Moldovan PIT purposes are subject to Moldovan tax for the income derived from Moldovan sources (e.g. income received from property located in Moldova, remuneration for activity performed in Moldova, interest and royalties received from Moldovan legal entities).</p><p><strong>Personal income tax rates</strong></p><p>For residents (standard taxation) <strong style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 55);\">12%</strong>:</p><ul><li>Income from employment, including benefits in kind and from professional or entrepreneurial activity</li><li>Capital gains</li><li>Other taxable income</li><li>Individual entrepreneurs</li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 65);\">Income for farming enterprises </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 65);\">7%</strong></li></ul><p>For non-residents:</p><ul><li>Income from employment, including benefits in kind <strong>12%</strong></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 65);\">Dividends, except for 2008 to 2011 profit distribution </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 65);\">6%</strong></li><li>Income from the withdrawn amount from the share equity related to previously increased share equity upon distribution of the net profit and/or other sources recorded in the owner's equity between shareholders (associates) according to the participation share in the equity for the fiscal period 2010/11. <strong>15%</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Corporate - Taxes on corporate income</strong></p><p>Resident companies generally must calculate their taxable base for CIT purposes on their worldwide income.

But it has plenty of advantages concerning company establishment and management, some of them being: low taxes compared to the rest of the countries in Europe, developed banking system, working flexibility of state institutions, online accounting reporting and the use of electronic signatures. Another benefit of setting up a company in the Republic of Moldova is that your involvement in the process can be minimal, as we at Bizonaire offer you personalized solutions that will fit your personal needs.</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 55);\">How do you register a Company in Moldova? 3 easy steps!</strong></p><p><strong>1st step</strong></p><p>First things first, you have to decide what is the type of activity that your company will undertake so that we can provide advice on the most appropriate entity for your needs. Below, we present some basic information regarding the most popular types of companies. But for a more in depth analysis you can read one of our previous articles on this subject.</p><p>A <strong>Limited Liability Company </strong>is formed by one or more individuals through a written agreement that includes provisions for management, assignability of interests, and distribution of profits and losses. It’s suitable for most trading businesses, it can operate anywhere in the world and can undertake almost any nature of activity other than banking or insurance.</p><p>A <strong>Joint Stock Company</strong> is necessary if the firm is planning to trade its shares to the public. It can operate anywhere in the world and is suitable for any nature of business, but it requires a high initial capital requirement.</p><p>A <strong>Sole Proprietorship Company</strong> is one individual or married couple in business alone. They are the most common form of business structure, it being easy to form and operate and flexible to manage, facing fewer legal controls and fewer taxes. However, the business owner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business.</p><p>Also, at this stage you have to pick the name of your company. This is both an exciting and also very important step, as the name of an enterprise is in most cases correlated to its success. The right name can make your company the talk of the town and the wrong one can doom it to failure. Ideally, your name should convey the expertise, value and uniqueness of the product or the service you offer.</p><p><strong>2nd step</strong></p><p>The next step does not require your involvement at all, just provide us with a copy of your Passport (if you are a foreign citizen) or Identity Card (if you are a citizen of Republic of Moldova). We are going to take care of all the needed documents and permits such as: Notification from the National Commission for the Financial Market for insurance agencies, social and pension funds and credit organizations, Decision on the establishment of a legal entity and its constituent documents, confirmation of payment of registration tax and others. Subsequently, we will apply on your behalf for the registration of the company at the Public Services Agency, giving you the opportunity to avoid the lines and the bureaucratic aspect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3rd step</strong></p><p>The last step consists of signing the company formation documents and receiving your newly registered firm’s document package. This is the only involvement required from you, as it is compulsory that you sign the papers yourself.&nbsp;You will be accompanied by our representatives to the Public Services Agency where you are going to sign the documents, for foreign citizens this procedure is preceded by a visit to the notary where a translator will present all the information included in the documents. We can also arrange transportation and accommodation for you, making sure your trip to Moldova is a productive and pleasant experience.</p><p>At Bizonaire, we aim to provide you a hassle-free experience regarding every aspect of your business. You name it and we have a solution to make it easier and more productive. We are all about efficiency and optimization without compromising the results.

This puts pressure on the pension system and limits the country’s long-term competitiveness.</p><p>In the near term, the formation of a new government supported by a parliamentary majority established in June 2019 is an opportunity to regain trust among citizens and international partners, strengthen the political system, de-polarize society, combat corruption, and speed up the reforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","info_legal":"<p>The Republic of Moldova is a location that is yet to be discovered as a business destination and an option that suits the needs of entrepreneurs. But it has plenty of advantages concerning company establishment and management, some of them being: low taxes compared to the rest of the countries in Europe, developed banking system, working flexibility of state institutions, online accounting reporting and the use of electronic signatures. Another benefit of setting up a company in the Republic of Moldova is that your involvement in the process can be minimal, as we at Bizonaire offer you personalized solutions that will fit your personal needs.</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 55);\">How do you register a Company in Moldova? 3 easy steps!</strong></p><p><strong>1st step</strong></p><p>First things first, you have to decide what is the type of activity that your company will undertake so that we can provide advice on the most appropriate entity for your needs. Below, we present some basic information regarding the most popular types of companies. But for a more in depth analysis you can read one of our previous articles on this subject.</p><p>A <strong>Limited Liability Company </strong>is formed by one or more individuals through a written agreement that includes provisions for management, assignability of interests, and distribution of profits and losses. It’s suitable for most trading businesses, it can operate anywhere in the world and can undertake almost any nature of activity other than banking or insurance.</p><p>A <strong>Joint Stock Company</strong> is necessary if the firm is planning to trade its shares to the public. It can operate anywhere in the world and is suitable for any nature of business, but it requires a high initial capital requirement.</p><p>A <strong>Sole Proprietorship Company</strong> is one individual or married couple in business alone. They are the most common form of business structure, it being easy to form and operate and flexible to manage, facing fewer legal controls and fewer taxes. However, the business owner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business.</p><p>Also, at this stage you have to pick the name of your company. This is both an exciting and also very important step, as the name of an enterprise is in most cases correlated to its success. The right name can make your company the talk of the town and the wrong one can doom it to failure. Ideally, your name should convey the expertise, value and uniqueness of the product or the service you offer.</p><p><strong>2nd step</strong></p><p>The next step does not require your involvement at all, just provide us with a copy of your Passport (if you are a foreign citizen) or Identity Card (if you are a citizen of Republic of Moldova). We are going to take care of all the needed documents and permits such as: Notification from the National Commission for the Financial Market for insurance agencies, social and pension funds and credit organizations, Decision on the establishment of a legal entity and its constituent documents, confirmation of payment of registration tax and others. Subsequently, we will apply on your behalf for the registration of the company at the Public Services Agency, giving you the opportunity to avoid the lines and the bureaucratic aspect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3rd step</strong></p><p>The last step consists of signing the company formation documents and receiving your newly registered firm’s document package. This is the only involvement required from you, as it is compulsory that you sign the papers yourself.&nbsp;You will be accompanied by our representatives to the Public Services Agency where you are going to sign the documents, for foreign citizens this procedure is preceded by a visit to the notary where a translator will present all the information included in the documents. We can also arrange transportation and accommodation for you, making sure your trip to Moldova is a productive and pleasant experience.</p><p>At Bizonaire, we aim to provide you a hassle-free experience regarding every aspect of your business. You name it and we have a solution to make it easier and more productive. We are all about efficiency and optimization without compromising the results. Embark on a business journey with us and we assure that you can forget about many stressful aspects that running a business implies.&nbsp;</p>","info_taxes":"<p>Moldovan residents (both Moldovan citizens and foreigners) are subject to taxation for their income received during the fiscal period from any sources within the Republic of Moldova, as well as from sources outside the country for their work activity effectively performed in the Republic of Moldova (except income that is expressly tax exempt under the Moldovan law).</p><p>Moldovan citizens receiving investment and financial income from sources outside Moldova are also subject to tax on this income in Moldova.At the same time, individuals qualifying as non-residents for Moldovan PIT purposes are subject to Moldovan tax for the income derived from Moldovan sources (e.g. income received from property located in Moldova, remuneration for activity performed in Moldova, interest and royalties received from Moldovan legal entities).</p><p><strong>Personal income tax rates</strong></p><p>For residents (standard taxation) <strong style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 55);\">12%</strong>:</p><ul><li>Income from employment, including benefits in kind and from professional or entrepreneurial activity</li><li>Capital gains</li><li>Other taxable income</li><li>Individual entrepreneurs</li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 65);\">Income for farming enterprises </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 65);\">7%</strong></li></ul><p>For non-residents:</p><ul><li>Income from employment, including benefits in kind <strong>12%</strong></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 65);\">Dividends, except for 2008 to 2011 profit distribution </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 65);\">6%</strong></li><li>Income from the withdrawn amount from the share equity related to previously increased share equity upon distribution of the net profit and/or other sources recorded in the owner's equity between shareholders (associates) according to the participation share in the equity for the fiscal period 2010/11. <strong>15%</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Corporate - Taxes on corporate income</strong></p><p>Resident companies generally must calculate their taxable base for CIT purposes on their worldwide income.

Romania’s trade connections stretch out into central Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Russia, and the Middle East – collectively representing a market of tens of millions of consumers.</p><p><strong>Skilled Workforce</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The Romanian labor force is young, educated, literate, and embodies a culture of commitment and integrity. Enrollment in university education has been increasing across Romania since 2011, with the most popular educational disciplines being business, administration and law, construction, and engineering.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Communication Networks</strong></p><p>Organisations doing business in Romania benefit from a well-developed communication infrastructure, which includes both a reliable telephone network, and country-wide high-speed fiber internet connections.</p><p>Romania’s internet speed is the best in the region (around 85.Mbps) – facilitated by a range of providers, and a healthy level of competition. 3G and 4G internet connection penetration in Romania reached of 87% in 2019.</p><p><strong>Business Processes &amp; Culture</strong></p><p>Romania was ranked 45 on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Survey 2018 – out of a possible 190. While the country’s business-language is English, the wider environment accommodates a wide range of eastern and western social and professional influences, and the foreign company registration landscape is welcoming to outsiders and expats alike.</p>","info_legal":"<p><strong>What is the legal system based on (details like civil law, common law and the mixture of both)?</strong></p><p>The law of Romania is civil law.</p><p><strong>What are the key recent developments affecting company registration in your jurisdiction?</strong></p><p>The new Civil Procedure Code of Romania became effective on 15 February 2013.</p><p>The new Civil Code of Romania entered into force on 1 October 2011, but there is a lack of consistent case law details relating to this. The new Civil Code introduced many new company registration concepts (for example, trust companies, specific regulation of standard clauses, special protection of legal entities under adherence contracts, freedom to agree contractually on prescription terms, and so on).</p><p><strong>Are there any restrictions on foreign company registrations format (including authorisations required by central or local government)?</strong></p><p>There are no longer any major format restrictions regarding foreign investment. A major restriction existed for foreign nationals to acquire agricultural land in Romania (as agreed under the Accession Treaty in 2005). On 1 January 2014, this restriction will be lifted and citizens of the EU or states belonging to the European Economic Area Agreement (EEAA) will be able to freely acquire agricultural lands in Romania. However, they will need to comply with the conditions of a pre-emption right, the detail consists in the fact that the acquisition of land must initially be refused by certain categories of people as defined by law.</p><p><strong>Reporting requirements</strong></p><p>The accounting format requires Limited Liability Companies registered in Romania to present documents like company registration proof, accounting records and financial statements in accordance with the Romanian Accounting Standards. For example, required documents must be prepared in Romanian and amounts stated in RON. In Romania, the financial year is the same as the calendar year. However certain companies and branches of foreign entities can opt for a financial year that is different to the calendar year, in order to reflect the financial year used by the parent company.</p>","info_taxes":"<p>Most Romanian businesses follow the company registration process that leads to the formation of a Limited Liability Company (LLC) – which, from a tax perspective, pays the same flat 16% corporate rate, as all other business structures. This means company registration in Romania benefits from certain structural details and advantages, including the possibility of 100% foreign ownership, relatively low starting capital requirements (RON 200/ 45 EURO), and, of course, the assurance that shareholder liabilities are limited to only their capital contributions.</p><p>Seemingly, company registration in Romania doesn't look like a very good idea with its 16% corporation tax rate. Although this rate is lower than that of Western European countries, it is somewhat higher than that of other countries in Eastern Europe.</p><p>In Romania, there was a special detail for small company formation entrepreneurs a few years ago. According to it, you only had to pay 3% of taxes on a turnover of up to €100,000 (but this was with regards to the total volume of sales made and not profits).</p><p>In 2018 the amount was extended considerably making the programme even more attractive. The turnover limit to qualify for this programme is now €1,000,000 and makes Romania an attractive option for company registration, even for online entrepreneurs with a higher income.</p><p>Taking into account the low salary costs and the fact that many Romanians have a good knowledge of English, hiring some type of assistant (virtual or not) in Romania could be a good option, including for digital nomads or micro-entrepreneurs.</p><p>The Romanian government has introduced a range of tax incentives for businesses operating in the country. These incentives include:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Foreign Tax Credits - credits are available for taxes paid to a foreign state, or member-state of the EEA - and may be claimed with required documents</li><li>Exemption for reinvested profits - tax exemption is available for profits reinvested in technological, electronic, or peripheral equipment ( including cash registers, software, invoicing machinery and more).</li><li>Local tax exemption - businesses which are located within industrial parks are exempt from paying property tax.</li></ol><p><br></p>","url":"romania","lang":"en"},"name":"Romania\r\n","info_description":"<p>The largest of the Balkan countries, Romania has a dramatic mountain scenery and a coastline on the Black Sea.

Romania’s trade connections stretch out into central Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Russia, and the Middle East – collectively representing a market of tens of millions of consumers.</p><p><strong>Skilled Workforce</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The Romanian labor force is young, educated, literate, and embodies a culture of commitment and integrity. Enrollment in university education has been increasing across Romania since 2011, with the most popular educational disciplines being business, administration and law, construction, and engineering.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Communication Networks</strong></p><p>Organisations doing business in Romania benefit from a well-developed communication infrastructure, which includes both a reliable telephone network, and country-wide high-speed fiber internet connections.</p><p>Romania’s internet speed is the best in the region (around 85.Mbps) – facilitated by a range of providers, and a healthy level of competition. 3G and 4G internet connection penetration in Romania reached of 87% in 2019.</p><p><strong>Business Processes &amp; Culture</strong></p><p>Romania was ranked 45 on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Survey 2018 – out of a possible 190. While the country’s business-language is English, the wider environment accommodates a wide range of eastern and western social and professional influences, and the foreign company registration landscape is welcoming to outsiders and expats alike.</p>","info_legal":"<p><strong>What is the legal system based on (details like civil law, common law and the mixture of both)?</strong></p><p>The law of Romania is civil law.</p><p><strong>What are the key recent developments affecting company registration in your jurisdiction?</strong></p><p>The new Civil Procedure Code of Romania became effective on 15 February 2013.</p><p>The new Civil Code of Romania entered into force on 1 October 2011, but there is a lack of consistent case law details relating to this. The new Civil Code introduced many new company registration concepts (for example, trust companies, specific regulation of standard clauses, special protection of legal entities under adherence contracts, freedom to agree contractually on prescription terms, and so on).</p><p><strong>Are there any restrictions on foreign company registrations format (including authorisations required by central or local government)?</strong></p><p>There are no longer any major format restrictions regarding foreign investment. A major restriction existed for foreign nationals to acquire agricultural land in Romania (as agreed under the Accession Treaty in 2005). On 1 January 2014, this restriction will be lifted and citizens of the EU or states belonging to the European Economic Area Agreement (EEAA) will be able to freely acquire agricultural lands in Romania. However, they will need to comply with the conditions of a pre-emption right, the detail consists in the fact that the acquisition of land must initially be refused by certain categories of people as defined by law.</p><p><strong>Reporting requirements</strong></p><p>The accounting format requires Limited Liability Companies registered in Romania to present documents like company registration proof, accounting records and financial statements in accordance with the Romanian Accounting Standards. For example, required documents must be prepared in Romanian and amounts stated in RON. In Romania, the financial year is the same as the calendar year. However certain companies and branches of foreign entities can opt for a financial year that is different to the calendar year, in order to reflect the financial year used by the parent company.</p>","info_taxes":"<p>Most Romanian businesses follow the company registration process that leads to the formation of a Limited Liability Company (LLC) – which, from a tax perspective, pays the same flat 16% corporate rate, as all other business structures. This means company registration in Romania benefits from certain structural details and advantages, including the possibility of 100% foreign ownership, relatively low starting capital requirements (RON 200/ 45 EURO), and, of course, the assurance that shareholder liabilities are limited to only their capital contributions.</p><p>Seemingly, company registration in Romania doesn't look like a very good idea with its 16% corporation tax rate. Although this rate is lower than that of Western European countries, it is somewhat higher than that of other countries in Eastern Europe.</p><p>In Romania, there was a special detail for small company formation entrepreneurs a few years ago. According to it, you only had to pay 3% of taxes on a turnover of up to €100,000 (but this was with regards to the total volume of sales made and not profits).</p><p>In 2018 the amount was extended considerably making the programme even more attractive. The turnover limit to qualify for this programme is now €1,000,000 and makes Romania an attractive option for company registration, even for online entrepreneurs with a higher income.</p><p>Taking into account the low salary costs and the fact that many Romanians have a good knowledge of English, hiring some type of assistant (virtual or not) in Romania could be a good option, including for digital nomads or micro-entrepreneurs.</p><p>The Romanian government has introduced a range of tax incentives for businesses operating in the country. These incentives include:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Foreign Tax Credits - credits are available for taxes paid to a foreign state, or member-state of the EEA - and may be claimed with required documents</li><li>Exemption for reinvested profits - tax exemption is available for profits reinvested in technological, electronic, or peripheral equipment ( including cash registers, software, invoicing machinery and more).</li><li>Local tax exemption - businesses which are located within industrial parks are exempt from paying property tax.</li></ol><p><br></p>"}}],"solution_lang":{"solution_lang_id":33,"solutionId":10,"lang":"en","title":"Expand Your Business in the EU","slug":"expand-your-business-in-the-eu","heroTitle":"Seamless EU Market Entry with Poland & Romania Business Setup","heroDescription":"Enter the European market with minimal costs and bureaucracy by setting up your business in Poland or Romania.

While the country’s business-language is English, the wider environment accommodates a wide range of eastern and western social and professional influences, and the foreign company registration landscape is welcoming to outsiders and expats alike.</p>","info_legal":"<p><strong>What is the legal system based on (details like civil law, common law and the mixture of both)?</strong></p><p>The law of Romania is civil law.</p><p><strong>What are the key recent developments affecting company registration in your jurisdiction?</strong></p><p>The new Civil Procedure Code of Romania became effective on 15 February 2013.</p><p>The new Civil Code of Romania entered into force on 1 October 2011, but there is a lack of consistent case law details relating to this. The new Civil Code introduced many new company registration concepts (for example, trust companies, specific regulation of standard clauses, special protection of legal entities under adherence contracts, freedom to agree contractually on prescription terms, and so on).</p><p><strong>Are there any restrictions on foreign company registrations format (including authorisations required by central or local government)?</strong></p><p>There are no longer any major format restrictions regarding foreign investment. A major restriction existed for foreign nationals to acquire agricultural land in Romania (as agreed under the Accession Treaty in 2005). On 1 January 2014, this restriction will be lifted and citizens of the EU or states belonging to the European Economic Area Agreement (EEAA) will be able to freely acquire agricultural lands in Romania. However, they will need to comply with the conditions of a pre-emption right, the detail consists in the fact that the acquisition of land must initially be refused by certain categories of people as defined by law.</p><p><strong>Reporting requirements</strong></p><p>The accounting format requires Limited Liability Companies registered in Romania to present documents like company registration proof, accounting records and financial statements in accordance with the Romanian Accounting Standards.

However certain companies and branches of foreign entities can opt for a financial year that is different to the calendar year, in order to reflect the financial year used by the parent company.</p>","info_taxes":"<p>Most Romanian businesses follow the company registration process that leads to the formation of a Limited Liability Company (LLC) – which, from a tax perspective, pays the same flat 16% corporate rate, as all other business structures. This means company registration in Romania benefits from certain structural details and advantages, including the possibility of 100% foreign ownership, relatively low starting capital requirements (RON 200/ 45 EURO), and, of course, the assurance that shareholder liabilities are limited to only their capital contributions.</p><p>Seemingly, company registration in Romania doesn't look like a very good idea with its 16% corporation tax rate.

Romania’s trade connections stretch out into central Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Russia, and the Middle East – collectively representing a market of tens of millions of consumers.</p><p><strong>Skilled Workforce</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The Romanian labor force is young, educated, literate, and embodies a culture of commitment and integrity. Enrollment in university education has been increasing across Romania since 2011, with the most popular educational disciplines being business, administration and law, construction, and engineering.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Communication Networks</strong></p><p>Organisations doing business in Romania benefit from a well-developed communication infrastructure, which includes both a reliable telephone network, and country-wide high-speed fiber internet connections.</p><p>Romania’s internet speed is the best in the region (around 85.Mbps) – facilitated by a range of providers, and a healthy level of competition. 3G and 4G internet connection penetration in Romania reached of 87% in 2019.</p><p><strong>Business Processes &amp; Culture</strong></p><p>Romania was ranked 45 on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Survey 2018 – out of a possible 190. While the country’s business-language is English, the wider environment accommodates a wide range of eastern and western social and professional influences, and the foreign company registration landscape is welcoming to outsiders and expats alike.</p>","info_legal":"<p><strong>What is the legal system based on (details like civil law, common law and the mixture of both)?</strong></p><p>The law of Romania is civil law.</p><p><strong>What are the key recent developments affecting company registration in your jurisdiction?</strong></p><p>The new Civil Procedure Code of Romania became effective on 15 February 2013.</p><p>The new Civil Code of Romania entered into force on 1 October 2011, but there is a lack of consistent case law details relating to this. The new Civil Code introduced many new company registration concepts (for example, trust companies, specific regulation of standard clauses, special protection of legal entities under adherence contracts, freedom to agree contractually on prescription terms, and so on).</p><p><strong>Are there any restrictions on foreign company registrations format (including authorisations required by central or local government)?</strong></p><p>There are no longer any major format restrictions regarding foreign investment. A major restriction existed for foreign nationals to acquire agricultural land in Romania (as agreed under the Accession Treaty in 2005). On 1 January 2014, this restriction will be lifted and citizens of the EU or states belonging to the European Economic Area Agreement (EEAA) will be able to freely acquire agricultural lands in Romania. However, they will need to comply with the conditions of a pre-emption right, the detail consists in the fact that the acquisition of land must initially be refused by certain categories of people as defined by law.</p><p><strong>Reporting requirements</strong></p><p>The accounting format requires Limited Liability Companies registered in Romania to present documents like company registration proof, accounting records and financial statements in accordance with the Romanian Accounting Standards. For example, required documents must be prepared in Romanian and amounts stated in RON. In Romania, the financial year is the same as the calendar year. However certain companies and branches of foreign entities can opt for a financial year that is different to the calendar year, in order to reflect the financial year used by the parent company.</p>","info_taxes":"<p>Most Romanian businesses follow the company registration process that leads to the formation of a Limited Liability Company (LLC) – which, from a tax perspective, pays the same flat 16% corporate rate, as all other business structures. This means company registration in Romania benefits from certain structural details and advantages, including the possibility of 100% foreign ownership, relatively low starting capital requirements (RON 200/ 45 EURO), and, of course, the assurance that shareholder liabilities are limited to only their capital contributions.</p><p>Seemingly, company registration in Romania doesn't look like a very good idea with its 16% corporation tax rate. Although this rate is lower than that of Western European countries, it is somewhat higher than that of other countries in Eastern Europe.</p><p>In Romania, there was a special detail for small company formation entrepreneurs a few years ago. According to it, you only had to pay 3% of taxes on a turnover of up to €100,000 (but this was with regards to the total volume of sales made and not profits).</p><p>In 2018 the amount was extended considerably making the programme even more attractive. The turnover limit to qualify for this programme is now €1,000,000 and makes Romania an attractive option for company registration, even for online entrepreneurs with a higher income.</p><p>Taking into account the low salary costs and the fact that many Romanians have a good knowledge of English, hiring some type of assistant (virtual or not) in Romania could be a good option, including for digital nomads or micro-entrepreneurs.</p><p>The Romanian government has introduced a range of tax incentives for businesses operating in the country.

Another benefit of setting up a company in the Republic of Moldova is that your involvement in the process can be minimal, as we at Bizonaire offer you personalized solutions that will fit your personal needs.</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 55);\">How do you register a Company in Moldova? 3 easy steps!</strong></p><p><strong>1st step</strong></p><p>First things first, you have to decide what is the type of activity that your company will undertake so that we can provide advice on the most appropriate entity for your needs. Below, we present some basic information regarding the most popular types of companies. But for a more in depth analysis you can read one of our previous articles on this subject.</p><p>A <strong>Limited Liability Company </strong>is formed by one or more individuals through a written agreement that includes provisions for management, assignability of interests, and distribution of profits and losses. It’s suitable for most trading businesses, it can operate anywhere in the world and can undertake almost any nature of activity other than banking or insurance.</p><p>A <strong>Joint Stock Company</strong> is necessary if the firm is planning to trade its shares to the public. It can operate anywhere in the world and is suitable for any nature of business, but it requires a high initial capital requirement.</p><p>A <strong>Sole Proprietorship Company</strong> is one individual or married couple in business alone. They are the most common form of business structure, it being easy to form and operate and flexible to manage, facing fewer legal controls and fewer taxes. However, the business owner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business.</p><p>Also, at this stage you have to pick the name of your company. This is both an exciting and also very important step, as the name of an enterprise is in most cases correlated to its success. The right name can make your company the talk of the town and the wrong one can doom it to failure. Ideally, your name should convey the expertise, value and uniqueness of the product or the service you offer.</p><p><strong>2nd step</strong></p><p>The next step does not require your involvement at all, just provide us with a copy of your Passport (if you are a foreign citizen) or Identity Card (if you are a citizen of Republic of Moldova). We are going to take care of all the needed documents and permits such as: Notification from the National Commission for the Financial Market for insurance agencies, social and pension funds and credit organizations, Decision on the establishment of a legal entity and its constituent documents, confirmation of payment of registration tax and others. Subsequently, we will apply on your behalf for the registration of the company at the Public Services Agency, giving you the opportunity to avoid the lines and the bureaucratic aspect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3rd step</strong></p><p>The last step consists of signing the company formation documents and receiving your newly registered firm’s document package. This is the only involvement required from you, as it is compulsory that you sign the papers yourself.&nbsp;You will be accompanied by our representatives to the Public Services Agency where you are going to sign the documents, for foreign citizens this procedure is preceded by a visit to the notary where a translator will present all the information included in the documents.

Although it is among the poorest countries in Europe, it has made significant progress in reducing poverty and promoting inclusive growth since the early 2000s.</p><p>The economy has expanded by an average of 5 percent annually, driven by consumption and fueled by remittances. The latter account for a quarter of GDP, among the highest shares in the world.</p><p>European integration has anchored successive governments' policy reform agendas, but reforms that are good on paper have yet to materialize. A vulnerable political system, polarized society, adverse external environment, and skills mismatch in the labor market, along with climate-related shocks, are Moldova’s biggest economic challenges.</p><p>Continued economic stabilization, the advancement of key economic reforms, and the creation of a rulebased environment for businesses are the country’s key goals. Moldova’s large-scale out-migration, combined with decreasing fertility rates, has led to an alarming decline in the population and increased the share of elderly people. This puts pressure on the pension system and limits the country’s long-term competitiveness.</p><p>In the near term, the formation of a new government supported by a parliamentary majority established in June 2019 is an opportunity to regain trust among citizens and international partners, strengthen the political system, de-polarize society, combat corruption, and speed up the reforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","info_legal":"<p>The Republic of Moldova is a location that is yet to be discovered as a business destination and an option that suits the needs of entrepreneurs. But it has plenty of advantages concerning company establishment and management, some of them being: low taxes compared to the rest of the countries in Europe, developed banking system, working flexibility of state institutions, online accounting reporting and the use of electronic signatures. Another benefit of setting up a company in the Republic of Moldova is that your involvement in the process can be minimal, as we at Bizonaire offer you personalized solutions that will fit your personal needs.</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 55);\">How do you register a Company in Moldova? 3 easy steps!</strong></p><p><strong>1st step</strong></p><p>First things first, you have to decide what is the type of activity that your company will undertake so that we can provide advice on the most appropriate entity for your needs. Below, we present some basic information regarding the most popular types of companies. But for a more in depth analysis you can read one of our previous articles on this subject.</p><p>A <strong>Limited Liability Company </strong>is formed by one or more individuals through a written agreement that includes provisions for management, assignability of interests, and distribution of profits and losses. It’s suitable for most trading businesses, it can operate anywhere in the world and can undertake almost any nature of activity other than banking or insurance.</p><p>A <strong>Joint Stock Company</strong> is necessary if the firm is planning to trade its shares to the public. It can operate anywhere in the world and is suitable for any nature of business, but it requires a high initial capital requirement.</p><p>A <strong>Sole Proprietorship Company</strong> is one individual or married couple in business alone. They are the most common form of business structure, it being easy to form and operate and flexible to manage, facing fewer legal controls and fewer taxes. However, the business owner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business.</p><p>Also, at this stage you have to pick the name of your company. This is both an exciting and also very important step, as the name of an enterprise is in most cases correlated to its success. The right name can make your company the talk of the town and the wrong one can doom it to failure. Ideally, your name should convey the expertise, value and uniqueness of the product or the service you offer.</p><p><strong>2nd step</strong></p><p>The next step does not require your involvement at all, just provide us with a copy of your Passport (if you are a foreign citizen) or Identity Card (if you are a citizen of Republic of Moldova). We are going to take care of all the needed documents and permits such as: Notification from the National Commission for the Financial Market for insurance agencies, social and pension funds and credit organizations, Decision on the establishment of a legal entity and its constituent documents, confirmation of payment of registration tax and others. Subsequently, we will apply on your behalf for the registration of the company at the Public Services Agency, giving you the opportunity to avoid the lines and the bureaucratic aspect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3rd step</strong></p><p>The last step consists of signing the company formation documents and receiving your newly registered firm’s document package. This is the only involvement required from you, as it is compulsory that you sign the papers yourself.&nbsp;You will be accompanied by our representatives to the Public Services Agency where you are going to sign the documents, for foreign citizens this procedure is preceded by a visit to the notary where a translator will present all the information included in the documents. We can also arrange transportation and accommodation for you, making sure your trip to Moldova is a productive and pleasant experience.</p><p>At Bizonaire, we aim to provide you a hassle-free experience regarding every aspect of your business.

Romania’s trade connections stretch out into central Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Russia, and the Middle East – collectively representing a market of tens of millions of consumers.</p><p><strong>Skilled Workforce</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The Romanian labor force is young, educated, literate, and embodies a culture of commitment and integrity. Enrollment in university education has been increasing across Romania since 2011, with the most popular educational disciplines being business, administration and law, construction, and engineering.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Communication Networks</strong></p><p>Organisations doing business in Romania benefit from a well-developed communication infrastructure, which includes both a reliable telephone network, and country-wide high-speed fiber internet connections.</p><p>Romania’s internet speed is the best in the region (around 85.Mbps) – facilitated by a range of providers, and a healthy level of competition. 3G and 4G internet connection penetration in Romania reached of 87% in 2019.</p><p><strong>Business Processes &amp; Culture</strong></p><p>Romania was ranked 45 on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Survey 2018 – out of a possible 190. While the country’s business-language is English, the wider environment accommodates a wide range of eastern and western social and professional influences, and the foreign company registration landscape is welcoming to outsiders and expats alike.</p>","info_legal":"<p><strong>What is the legal system based on (details like civil law, common law and the mixture of both)?</strong></p><p>The law of Romania is civil law.</p><p><strong>What are the key recent developments affecting company registration in your jurisdiction?</strong></p><p>The new Civil Procedure Code of Romania became effective on 15 February 2013.</p><p>The new Civil Code of Romania entered into force on 1 October 2011, but there is a lack of consistent case law details relating to this. The new Civil Code introduced many new company registration concepts (for example, trust companies, specific regulation of standard clauses, special protection of legal entities under adherence contracts, freedom to agree contractually on prescription terms, and so on).</p><p><strong>Are there any restrictions on foreign company registrations format (including authorisations required by central or local government)?</strong></p><p>There are no longer any major format restrictions regarding foreign investment. A major restriction existed for foreign nationals to acquire agricultural land in Romania (as agreed under the Accession Treaty in 2005). On 1 January 2014, this restriction will be lifted and citizens of the EU or states belonging to the European Economic Area Agreement (EEAA) will be able to freely acquire agricultural lands in Romania. However, they will need to comply with the conditions of a pre-emption right, the detail consists in the fact that the acquisition of land must initially be refused by certain categories of people as defined by law.</p><p><strong>Reporting requirements</strong></p><p>The accounting format requires Limited Liability Companies registered in Romania to present documents like company registration proof, accounting records and financial statements in accordance with the Romanian Accounting Standards. For example, required documents must be prepared in Romanian and amounts stated in RON. In Romania, the financial year is the same as the calendar year. However certain companies and branches of foreign entities can opt for a financial year that is different to the calendar year, in order to reflect the financial year used by the parent company.</p>","info_taxes":"<p>Most Romanian businesses follow the company registration process that leads to the formation of a Limited Liability Company (LLC) – which, from a tax perspective, pays the same flat 16% corporate rate, as all other business structures. This means company registration in Romania benefits from certain structural details and advantages, including the possibility of 100% foreign ownership, relatively low starting capital requirements (RON 200/ 45 EURO), and, of course, the assurance that shareholder liabilities are limited to only their capital contributions.</p><p>Seemingly, company registration in Romania doesn't look like a very good idea with its 16% corporation tax rate. Although this rate is lower than that of Western European countries, it is somewhat higher than that of other countries in Eastern Europe.</p><p>In Romania, there was a special detail for small company formation entrepreneurs a few years ago. According to it, you only had to pay 3% of taxes on a turnover of up to €100,000 (but this was with regards to the total volume of sales made and not profits).</p><p>In 2018 the amount was extended considerably making the programme even more attractive. The turnover limit to qualify for this programme is now €1,000,000 and makes Romania an attractive option for company registration, even for online entrepreneurs with a higher income.</p><p>Taking into account the low salary costs and the fact that many Romanians have a good knowledge of English, hiring some type of assistant (virtual or not) in Romania could be a good option, including for digital nomads or micro-entrepreneurs.</p><p>The Romanian government has introduced a range of tax incentives for businesses operating in the country. These incentives include:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Foreign Tax Credits - credits are available for taxes paid to a foreign state, or member-state of the EEA - and may be claimed with required documents</li><li>Exemption for reinvested profits - tax exemption is available for profits reinvested in technological, electronic, or peripheral equipment ( including cash registers, software,

largest of the Balkan countries, Romania has a dramatic mountain scenery and a coastline on the Black Sea. Romania has a population of 19.8 million people (2019), capital and largest city is Bucharest. Spoken language is Romanian (official).</p><p><strong>The economy</strong> of Romania has a fast developing, upper middle income mixed economy format with a very high Human Development Index number and a skilled labour force, ranked 15th in the European Union by total nominal GDP and 10th largest when adjusted by purchasing power parity.</p><p><strong>Strategic Location</strong></p><p>Located on the western shore of the Black Sea, and bordered by Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova, company registration in Romania offers geographic advantages and details for businesses wishing to gain foothold in eastern Europe and beyond. Romania’s trade connections stretch out into central Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Russia, and the Middle East – collectively representing a market of tens of millions of consumers.</p><p><strong>Skilled Workforce</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The Romanian labor force is young, educated, literate, and embodies a culture of commitment and integrity. Enrollment in university education has been increasing across Romania since 2011, with the most popular educational disciplines being business, administration and law, construction, and engineering.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Communication Networks</strong></p><p>Organisations doing business in Romania benefit from a well-developed communication infrastructure, which includes both a reliable telephone network, and country-wide high-speed fiber internet connections.</p><p>Romania’s internet speed is the best in the region (around 85.Mbps) – facilitated by a range of providers, and a healthy level of competition. 3G and 4G internet connection penetration in Romania reached of 87% in 2019.</p><p><strong>Business Processes &amp; Culture</strong></p><p>Romania was ranked 45 on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Survey 2018 – out of a possible 190. While the country’s business-language is English, the wider environment accommodates a wide range of eastern and western social and professional influences, and the foreign company registration landscape is welcoming to outsiders and expats alike.</p>","info_legal":"<p><strong>What is the legal system based on (details like civil law, common law and the mixture of both)?</strong></p><p>The law of Romania is civil law.</p><p><strong>What are the key recent developments affecting company registration in your jurisdiction?</strong></p><p>The new Civil Procedure Code of Romania became effective on 15 February 2013.</p><p>The new Civil Code of Romania entered into force on 1 October 2011, but there is a lack of consistent case law details relating to this. The new Civil Code introduced many new company registration concepts (for example, trust companies, specific regulation of standard clauses, special protection of legal entities under adherence contracts, freedom to agree contractually on prescription terms, and so on).</p><p><strong>Are there any restrictions on foreign company registrations format (including authorisations required by central or local government)?</strong></p><p>There are no longer any major format restrictions regarding foreign investment. A major restriction existed for foreign nationals to acquire agricultural land in Romania (as agreed under the Accession Treaty in 2005). On 1 January 2014, this restriction will be lifted and citizens of the EU or states belonging to the European Economic Area Agreement (EEAA) will be able to freely acquire agricultural lands in Romania. However, they will need to comply with the conditions of a pre-emption right, the detail consists in the fact that the acquisition of land must initially be refused by certain categories of people as defined by law.</p><p><strong>Reporting requirements</strong></p><p>The accounting format requires Limited Liability Companies registered in Romania to present documents like company registration proof, accounting records and financial statements in accordance with the Romanian Accounting Standards. For example, required documents must be prepared in Romanian and amounts stated in RON. In Romania, the financial year is the same as the calendar year. However certain companies and branches of foreign entities can opt for a financial year that is different to the calendar year, in order to reflect the financial year used by the parent company.</p>","info_taxes":"<p>Most Romanian businesses follow the company registration process that leads to the formation of a Limited Liability Company (LLC) – which, from a tax perspective, pays the same flat 16% corporate rate, as all other business structures. This means company registration in Romania benefits from certain structural details and advantages, including the possibility of 100% foreign ownership, relatively low starting capital requirements (RON 200/ 45 EURO), and, of course, the assurance that shareholder liabilities are limited to only their capital contributions.</p><p>Seemingly, company registration in Romania doesn't look like a very good idea with its 16% corporation tax rate. Although this rate is lower than that of Western European countries, it is somewhat higher than that of other countries in Eastern Europe.</p><p>In Romania, there was a special detail for small company formation entrepreneurs a few years ago. According to it, you only had to pay 3% of taxes on a turnover of up to €100,000 (but this was with regards to the total volume of sales made and not profits).</p><p>In 2018 the amount was extended considerably making the programme even more attractive. The turnover limit to qualify for this programme is now €1,000,000 and makes Romania an attractive option for company registration, even for online entrepreneurs with a higher income.</p><p>Taking into account the low salary costs and the fact that many Romanians have a good knowledge of English, hiring some type of assistant (virtual or not) in Romania could be a good option, including for digital nomads or micro-entrepreneurs.</p><p>The Romanian government has introduced a range of tax incentives for businesses operating in the country. These incentives include:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Foreign Tax Credits - credits are available for taxes paid to a foreign state, or member-state of the EEA - and may be claimed with required documents</li><li>Exemption for reinvested profits - tax exemption is available for profits reinvested in technological, electronic, or peripheral equipment ( including cash registers, software, invoicing machinery and more).</li><li>Local tax exemption - businesses which are located within industrial parks are exempt from paying property tax.</li></ol><p><br></p>"},{"country_id":167,"iso2":"MD","country_lang":{"country_lang_id":575,"country_id":167,"name":"Moldova","info_description":"<p><strong>Economic Description</strong></p><p>Moldova is a small lower-middle-income economy.

It’s suitable for most trading businesses, it can operate anywhere in the world and can undertake almost any nature of activity other than banking or insurance.</p><p>A <strong>Joint Stock Company</strong> is necessary if the firm is planning to trade its shares to the public. It can operate anywhere in the world and is suitable for any nature of business, but it requires a high initial capital requirement.</p><p>A <strong>Sole Proprietorship Company</strong> is one individual or married couple in business alone. They are the most common form of business structure, it being easy to form and operate and flexible to manage, facing fewer legal controls and fewer taxes. However, the business owner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business.</p><p>Also, at this stage you have to pick the name of your company. This is both an exciting and also very important step, as the name of an enterprise is in most cases correlated to its success. The right name can make your company the talk of the town and the wrong one can doom it to failure. Ideally, your name should convey the expertise, value and uniqueness of the product or the service you offer.</p><p><strong>2nd step</strong></p><p>The next step does not require your involvement at all, just provide us with a copy of your Passport (if you are a foreign citizen) or Identity Card (if you are a citizen of Republic of Moldova).

Although it is among the poorest countries in Europe, it has made significant progress in reducing poverty and promoting inclusive growth since the early 2000s.</p><p>The economy has expanded by an average of 5 percent annually, driven by consumption and fueled by remittances. The latter account for a quarter of GDP, among the highest shares in the world.</p><p>European integration has anchored successive governments' policy reform agendas, but reforms that are good on paper have yet to materialize. A vulnerable political system, polarized society, adverse external environment, and skills mismatch in the labor market, along with climate-related shocks, are Moldova’s biggest economic challenges.</p><p>Continued economic stabilization, the advancement of key economic reforms, and the creation of a rulebased environment for businesses are the country’s key goals. Moldova’s large-scale out-migration, combined with decreasing fertility rates, has led to an alarming decline in the population and increased the share of elderly people. This puts pressure on the pension system and limits the country’s long-term competitiveness.</p><p>In the near term, the formation of a new government supported by a parliamentary majority established in June 2019 is an opportunity to regain trust among citizens and international partners, strengthen the political system, de-polarize society, combat corruption, and speed up the reforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","info_legal":"<p>The Republic of Moldova is a location that is yet to be discovered as a business destination and an option that suits the needs of entrepreneurs. But it has plenty of advantages concerning company establishment and management, some of them being: low taxes compared to the rest of the countries in Europe, developed banking system, working flexibility of state institutions, online accounting reporting and the use of electronic signatures. Another benefit of setting up a company in the Republic of Moldova is that your involvement in the process can be minimal, as we at Bizonaire offer you personalized solutions that will fit your personal needs.</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(25, 25, 55);\">How do you register a Company in Moldova? 3 easy steps!</strong></p><p><strong>1st step</strong></p><p>First things first, you have to decide what is the type of activity that your company will undertake so that we can provide advice on the most appropriate entity for your needs.

It’s suitable for most trading businesses, it can operate anywhere in the world and can undertake almost any nature of activity other than banking or insurance.</p><p>A <strong>Joint Stock Company</strong> is necessary if the firm is planning to trade its shares to the public. It can operate anywhere in the world and is suitable for any nature of business, but it requires a high initial capital requirement.</p><p>A <strong>Sole Proprietorship Company</strong> is one individual or married couple in business alone. They are the most common form of business structure, it being easy to form and operate and flexible to manage, facing fewer legal controls and fewer taxes. However, the business owner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business.</p><p>Also, at this stage you have to pick the name of your company. This is both an exciting and also very important step, as the name of an enterprise is in most cases correlated to its success. The right name can make your company the talk of the town and the wrong one can doom it to failure. Ideally, your name should convey the expertise, value and uniqueness of the product or the service you offer.</p><p><strong>2nd step</strong></p><p>The next step does not require your involvement at all, just provide us with a copy of your Passport (if you are a foreign citizen) or Identity Card (if you are a citizen of Republic of Moldova). We are going to take care of all the needed documents and permits such as: Notification from the National Commission for the Financial Market for insurance agencies, social and pension funds and credit organizations, Decision on the establishment of a legal entity and its constituent documents, confirmation of payment of registration tax and others. Subsequently, we will apply on your behalf for the registration of the company at the Public Services Agency, giving you the opportunity to avoid the lines and the bureaucratic aspect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3rd step</strong></p><p>The last step consists of signing the company formation documents and receiving your newly registered firm’s document package. This is the only involvement required from you, as it is compulsory that you sign the papers yourself.&nbsp;You will be accompanied by our representatives to the Public Services Agency where you are going to sign the documents, for foreign citizens this procedure is preceded by a visit to the notary where a translator will present all the information included in the documents.
